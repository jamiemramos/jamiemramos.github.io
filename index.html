<h1> About Me</h1>

<h2> My name is Jamie Ramos and I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</h2>
<h3>I study information science, marine science, and public policy, in hopes that one day I can combine my passions and skills into one amazing, fulfilling career. </h3>

<h3> I love lots of different things, but my hobbies include following current events, listening to music, going to concerts and events, and spending time with friends, family, and animals.
This is my website, where you can find any information about me you might need, including how to contact me! 
I hope you have a nice time while you are here!</h3>
