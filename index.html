<h1> Hello there instructor! </h1>
<h3>I am glad you've successfully located my site. </h3> 
<h2>What's my plan?</h2>
<p> My plan is to make a personal site/portfolio.</p>
<h2>What will this include?</h2>
<p> This would include things like writing samples, my resume, links to/photographs of different programs I participate in, and other items.</p>
<p>The design might change over time.  </p>
<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I need to create content for one of the leadership development programs I am in and I think this website would be a good way to work this out.</p>
<h2>Who is my audience?</h2>
<p>My target audience is potential employers or people in my professional network. </p>
