<p> Hello there instructor! I am glad you've successfully located my site. My plan for this website is to create a portfolio/personal website. This would include things like writing samples, my resume, links to/photographs of different programs I participate in, and other items. I need to create content for one of the leadership development programs I am in and I think this website would be a good way to work this out. The design might change over time. My target audience is potential employers or people in my professional network. </p>
